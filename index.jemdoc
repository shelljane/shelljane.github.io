== Biography
I am a second-year Ph.D. Student at [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk the Department of Computer Science and Engineering], [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)],
under the supervision of [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/ Prof. Bei YU] and [https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/DeanMessage/ Prof. Martin D.F. Wong] since Fall 2022. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. and M.S. degree from [https://www.fudan.edu.cn/ Fudan University] under the supervision of [https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/3c/c31133a352316/page.htm Prof. Lingli Wang] in 2015-2022.\n 

My research interest is to solve critical problems in electronic design automation (EDA) with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods. 
Besides research, I love playing the piano and listening to classical music in my spare time.
