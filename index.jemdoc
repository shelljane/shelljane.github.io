== Biography
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Student at [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk the Department of Computer Science and Engineering], [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)],
under the supervision of [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/ Prof. Bei YU] and [https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/DeanMessage/ Prof. Martin D.F. Wong] since Fall 2022. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. and M.S. degree from [https://www.fudan.edu.cn/ Fudan University] under the supervision of [https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/3c/c31133a352316/page.htm Prof. Lingli Wang] in 2015-2022. 
I also spent one year as a visiting scholar in [https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong Prof. Jason Cong]’s lab at UCLA, during 2024.09-2025.09.\n

My research interest is to solve critical problems in electronic design automation (EDA) with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods. 
Besides research, I love playing the piano and listening to classical music in my spare time.
